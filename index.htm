His hyperness caused lot of trouble in the village he stayed, so the mayor of the village wrote a TEXT to that boy's parents stating the trouble he caused. But sadly the mayors computer only accepted MARKUP LANGUAGE. So he could not send a text to the boy's parents and hence the village continued to adjust with the boys's hyperness. ")
